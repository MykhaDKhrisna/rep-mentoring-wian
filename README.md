# repo for each group

you guys can push your source code to the branch based on your group number

how you guys can do it ?

easy:
- first you need to clone this repo using command `git clone https://github.com/wianoski/rep-mentoring-wian`
- then after clone the repo, you guys can open a terminal to the folder workspace
- inside the folder workspace, you guys need to change the branch that assigned to you, for example `git checkout kelompok-15` , from here you guys can commit your works to this branch
- if you guys already done with editing or working with the files, you guys can run git command start with `git add .` to add all changed files to the git HEAD
- after using `git add .` you need to comment the changed files with `git commit -m "insert comment here"`
- after comments the changed files, the final step is to push the files to the repo, using `git push origin kelompok-15`

done, easy isn't ?
